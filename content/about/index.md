Hi! My name is Tor and I am a mostly self-trained Software Developer hailing from Honolulu, and I develop primarily for the web.

For as long as I can remember I have loved to build things, and every finished project just spawned new ideas to pursue. If I have to attribute any one thing to my start in programming, I would say it was Legos. As a kid I had the luxury of more Legos than I knew what to do with, and after Legos I had "Zometools", which let me build even stranger and more complex things. Not long after that I received one of the first Lego Mindstorms kits and began learning how to program the yellow brick to power my strange creations.

Fast forward to 16 years old I found a book on Lisp and stumbled upon [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)'s Ruby tutorials and I just started playing with languages. I very quickly realized I had stumbled upon a means of building something that could be massive in scale without littering the floor with plastic caltrops.

I set about scouring the internet for all kinds of resources from forum posts and blogs to video tutorials. Following that I found interest in conference talk recordings and diving into GitHub repositories. After a couple of years playing with Ruby, Python, JavaScript, PHP, and C, I decided I wanted to build for the platforms I used the most-- the web browsers.

I started to reinforce my HTML knowledge and pick up web frameworks like Rails, Drupal, WordPress, and later Meteor. I realized around then that I had incurred a massive debt to open source communities. I resolved at that point to pursue a degree in a Computer related field and further develop my skills so that I can give back to open source.

Long story short I am addicted to learning and building new things, and sharing everything I learn with others.

## What I am usually up to

I recently graduated from UH Computer Science program with a B.S. in Computer Science, and left my position as a Web Programmer for the Distance Course Design & Consulting group at UH Manoa. When school was in session I was easily found amongst the computer related clubs on campus and now I hang out in chat channels all over the web.

When I could find the time, I taught a variety of topics about programming and software engineering to fellow students. I have taught high school and college students how to develop with git, fundamental programming concepts, program design, test-driven and behavior-driven development, and some topics relating to specific programming languages (e.g. Functional vs OO programming).

More recently since graduating I have taken to contributing more to [GitHub](https://github.com/torleif-nielsen) and writing for the [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/@torleif-nielsen/) platform.
