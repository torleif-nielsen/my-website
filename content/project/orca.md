The *ORCA \(Online Resource & Content Administrator\)* platform is a project I would like to develop in response to the LMS frameworks and platforms in use such as Sakai, Moodle, Blackboard, and others. Having used Blackboard and Sakai as a student I found myself very stressed with the platform and wished many of the features would be more friendly and be more performant.

I would also to accomplish building a system that could be distributed easily over a long distance and many hot-pluggable nodes but still function as a single application with a means of populating rich content to better support a learning environment.

This is still very much in the planning stage but I am looking at using Elixir, Elm, and Phoenix to begin work on this.
